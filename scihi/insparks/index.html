    Our mission is to inspire and empower the next generation of innovators through robotics. We strive to create a dynamic and 
    inclusive high school robotics club where students can explore, learn, and excel in the exciting field of robotics and coding. 
    Our club is dedicated to fostering creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills while promoting a passion for science, 
    technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Together, we aim to build, design and compete with cutting-edge robots that 
    tackle real-world challenges, preparing our members for a future driven by innovation and automation.</div>
  <div class="Title-THT3" style=" width: 678px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"><span id="Title-THT"><b>Vision</b></span><br>
    Our vision is to be the leading high school robotics club known for its commitment to excellence, diversity, and community 
    engagement. We envision a future where our members are not only proficient in robotics and coding, but also compassionate 
    leaders who use their skills to make a positive impact on society. Through continuous learning, collaboration and outreach, 
    we aspire to create a supportive and healthy environment that encourages our members to think critically, aim high, and 
    transform their ideas into reality. Together, we are shaping the future of robotics while inspring others to embrace the 
    limitless posibilities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</div>
