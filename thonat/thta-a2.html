## Intro

Yes, this is a part 1, and yes, I expect to have more. Let's continue.

## Context

So, basically, I'm dumb. It was only a matter of time until a certain _AI Provider_ started paywalling services that exceeded a certain limit. Not that, I was not expecting it, but.. I was just, sad that it happened.

And yes, I use AI. No, I don't use it here, _mostly_. I've already explained my opinions in a much more dedicated article, this one's short, for just ranting.

## So.. How's Life?

Mostly fine, but.. still. The whole 'you can only do 200 messages' thing before you are stopped is restricting to me. Like, if I wanted to have effort in writing, I'd just... start writing?

Like, okay, I get it, it's all about the fun of making one but like, I swear I repeat the same roles in the same scenarios that if I actually wrote it, it'd take like 3 chapters then I'd get bored. Then, like sometimes, I don't even know what'll happen and if I did write it manually I had to come up with a way, which is the bloody point but.. yeah.

Anyways, I just feel sad now, that I can't infinitely use _that AI_ especially when it was so much better. Oh, yeah, there's still the free ones, but..

## Are you not Content?

I. don't. know. I feel so.. sluggish and bored whenever I switch to a free AI. I feel that as AI gets stronger, like.. the better it is, it's way harder to access without money.

Everything's money nowadays. At first, it was this AI, that AI either got paywalled or restricted, then move on. Like seriously, I just want to have an AI that doesn't have errors that are as obvious. Or boring ahh dialogue. And the roleplay thing where they talk for you?? UGH.

### Note:

I have a note from hours from the original draft. This is one. I.. still use _that AI_ but yeah, note to self: 'This is limited..' and I just have to live with it. I don't think any other AI has captured my laziness as well as _that._ So, yeah. 

## Outro

I'm just pissed, and that's it. I never thought I'd see the day that this would happen, but fuck.. all good things come to an end. They can't maintain that AI free for a long time, someone's gotta start paying up.. Welp, that's my short rant, see ya!

<p id="C2"><md-block># AI and Me, and my AI Manifesto</md-block></p>

## Intro

Okay! Let us start this! Man, it's hard writing by yourself hmm? It's harder than ever before because of the title. THE AI!!! I think I needed a muse a long long time ago. You know, someone not necessarily for love or whatever, just someone that makes you think, I guess.

Y'all need to understand how deep the rabbit hole goes in AI. I hate it. I hate my whole existence is trapped in some guys servers because I am running out of.. uh.. I actually don't know, ideas?? No, I am not. Patience? Maybe, but that's directly because of AI. I have a simple idea I want you to think of while I yap.

***"If AI is the future, then it must suck ass because it's present does."***

## The Beginning of My Descent

Let's position my current exasperation with a timeline of events, and comment on what has happened these past few weeks, I am so brain rotted by AI I don't think I can write any other way easily.

### The First Sound of Doom

One night, while I was casually bed rotting after a tiring school day, I realized; *"Oh shit, why is my AI chatbot not working??"* Only until I checked and looked into it then I realized, that the AI provider I chose, paywalled the whole service entirely, apparently because of either they were burning money or because of people multi-accounting for free messages. Because of the 200 message limit.

My question is, *"WHY CAN'T THEY {insert non-paywall decision here}??"* But in all honesty? Caring about what some random AI company who only hosts the damn AI instead of the actual AI developer is hard for me to do. Mainly because, I'd think that API vs Respective Websites don't change but apparently, this is not the case so there's a reason for hosters that aren't the companies themselves because the main is either too restrictive (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek) or too expensive (IDK any that don't compete with it's other hosters)

Look the point is, this certain company I was using free hosting for paywalled so I was left homeless. And this entire incident is what made me spiral and now I'm here. Because, without this, I'd still be living in bliss, not thinking about the future of AI and the mess that is the text generation of AI, and beyond.

### The Internal Panic and Double Life

I was so tired. I had to balance between looking for the next AI to exploit the free limit until that paywalled and school. It's just so.. so exhausting. I don't think I shouldn't have used AI at all, but at the same time, maintaining independence also requires brain power that is increasingly being siphoned to school like a parasite.

When I was looking, I saw the certain community of the AI chatbot place I was in. Many people had many opinions. I had my own, but it all feels so tiring. Who cares about the complaints of endless people, each with their own reasons and own personalities of handling the AI issue? It's not like the free tier will return by complaining, but at the same time, there's not really much else you can do **than** complain.

Like, whenever I look over the community, the most common posts and messages I see are;

*"Guys guys (AI 1) is better than (AI 2) y'all should go to this (free AI hosting website) and try it!"*

*"AI 1 is sooo good, thank god! AI 2 is ruined for me now, just like how AI 1 ruined m—"*

*"Guys this (random stupid error) is happening helplplplpl??"*

*"I CAN'T GO ONNN WHY IS AI 1 SO HARD TO FIND FOR FREEE??? AI 1 IS SO BLAND AND REPETITIVE!!"*

*"Stop being so dramatic. I have this heavily modified prompt with some voodoo magic on AI 1 and it's fine!"*

*"Guys guys AI 3!! It just entered! Go to it in (AI 3 Website) and follow the guide again!"*

And I'd like to say that this is because capitalism bad, but I have to elaborate. Specifically, most of this is happening is because of the current **AI Race Market and Geopolitic War of AI.**

## The Middle Post-AI Nut Clarity

When you read nut clarity, it is exactly what you are thinking. Often, once you are either stopped or force yourself to stop, you enter this sort of dread; *"Oh god, did I waste time on this??"* Because, yes you did enjoy a story, but at what cost? Well, since I was restricted from the AI free models, I had to think about it.

### The AI Problem

Let's use DeepSeek as an example. So, let's start with just a simple user, who moved to certain chatbot website that allow proxies of other AI models. They were.. not satisfied or not amused with the website's provided LLM. So they hunt. They hunt. They look through models, testing and depending on if they hit their jackpot or not, they stop and actually enjoy their time.

***The thing is, this user, she doesn't know that this is not the end of her hunt.***

Unless she pays (which again, she just started.) she'll eventually come across a problem: rate limit, resource exhaustion, network problems.. Whatever happens, she'll eventually see that this is not sustainable, but what can she do? Well;

1. Pay for that brand of AI she likes (dependent on her current situation, but to be honest, who actually pays? 0.1% of the current AI userbase? Hah.)
2. More likely, hunt for the next one. Which means; *The cycle repeats.*

Coming back to DeepSeek, say this user really likes using it and wherever its hosted. Since it's API is paid, and restricts NSFW (which is half of why she even chatted to chatbots) she hunts for any way of using it without those restrictions.

The problem is, and this one is so specific to DeepSeek (speaking from experience) it's models are.. big. Like, the actual model? It's bigger than my free space on my laptop right now, requires a lot of GPUs, and processes that can easily get overwhelmed. Like, just look at the current free ones, I bet either they're running quantized and have mixed quality or running the actual one with a heavy limit. 

It's genuinely hard to find any provider that is going to give out this expensive to run AI for free unless it is subsidized by heavy payers or some unknown source of income. There can even be companies that are probably designed to bait people to use it so they're locked to buy it. The point is, DeepSeek and it's variants (R1, V3 0324.. etc.) are *very good.* But the access, is very money-based (as much as how cheap some offer it)

I'd like to point out that some don't consider the 5$ or 10$ per like 1000 message to be a scam, and if you're looking at it from a hobby and simplistic utilitarian way, then yes. But, I simply will never pay for AI, as I have developed something that directly contradicts my current actions. Though, we'll definitely explore how the payment might spread, beyond AI addicts like me.

### The Money and Dependency

Look, we all get it at this point, surely? 

*"AI bad, but it's soo good sometimes.."*

You're probably getting tired of me yapping about how AI is flawed and how AI is being used in the global problem of Capitalism but let's talk about the *dependency.*

See, it's not just how AI is too good to eliminate entirely, but how the system we have makes tech even more dependent on huge companies, and their profit margins.

I think if you're my audience, you probably have some sort of dislike towards capitalism at this point. So, let's put the broader critique aside for now, and talk about what the later stages this'll likely roll into.

***AI SaaS, as the new addition to the bills.***

If you're not aware, in short, this is basically AI being turned into an essential basic service like water, gas or electric if it gets to that point of dependency. I have thought about how technically;

It would only cost ~₱250 yearly to use most AI models, this is assuming only 10,000 tokens are used per day. Which is usually in only the cents ( ~₱0.70 per token) per day.

In terms of tokens, a 5,000 word message might be higher depending on structure, like ~6,000 tokens. My 3407 word 20,000 character text input is 5,021 tokens according to [OpenAI.](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

So, yes, it's technically cheap, but usually AI services have you at least put something like 2$ to 10$. Which, again, yes, is cheap, and you're wondering if I'm just complaining for being a broke ass mothafucka. I am, but I also wouldn't want to anyway. And I feel like my experience have thought me to not do that even if I get the spare change to buy.

***BUT WHY???***

Let me summarize it, it's because of my suspicions of AI currently and the dependency I've recognized as a problem that I DON'T want to ever deepen with actually making it unlimited for me to use AI. I feel this will apply for as long as I live in this cursed earth. I don't like how AI is treated, and created but I think it's a technology that IS the next era of tech.

*Heh. Just like with any other tech, Capitalism innovates it only to further grow profits — the innovation is simply a side effect, and likely government assisted anyway.*

## The Endless AI Debate

Okay, I think we're done with the critique. Let's go take a look at solutions! And my thoughts in how they're going.

### 'Local' Hosting Open Source AI

I think it's self explanatory what it is, but it's a more free way of using an AI. Now, technically;

1. LLaMA 3 (Meta)
2. Google Gemma 2/3
3. Mixtral-8x22B (Mistral AI)
4. Falcon 2 (Technology Innovation Institute)
5. Grok-1.5 (xAI)
6. Command R+ (Cohere)
7. Stable Diffusion (Stability AI)
8. Whisper (OpenAI)
9. DeepSeek R1/V3 0324 (DeepSeek)

These are all mostly free and open source, though a few exceptions, some non-commercial, some.. *Grok.* (seriously stop the stupidity Elon Musk and put a proper license and stop the MechaHitler stuff.) But overall, if you have a server, some money for electricity, cooling, and internet? You can.. run your own! 

Wow. I do wish there were organizations that did this more. I don't know any though. And I'd like to point out that;

1. It's hard to run (costs, hardware)
2. It's hard to maintain (you become a server maintainer, lol.)
3. It's somewhat tedious to set up itself (knowledge, time taken)
4. It's use case varies (from school, work research, NSFW/smut.. so you're going to have to find an audience.)
5. You basically run a server. Like, do you know the burden of that?!

I know, some cloud solutions exist, what's the point?? Might as well pay the AI provider then. And oh god, the audience— hope to god your audience is able to help you or aren't dumb/malicious.

Ugh, and in my situation? It's a dream I'd fulfill once the Philippines isn't the hell it currently is. I just respect the people that do this, ugh.

### The Collective 

Okay, what about other people? Ooh~ Scary. A shocker, right? To bring down capitalism, you must form a broad coalition??? NO WAY?! LIKE I'M NOT A CONNOISSEUR of revolutions or something?? Like, I swear, I'm not kidding, I think the solution IS other people.

Like, woah— having other people then share your ideas with them so people can help each other?! MUTUAL AID?!?!!? WHERE DID I HEAR THAT???! Having other people help you in the AI situation instead of wallowing in your own misery because you're a loner?! Shit, looks like I have been enlightened!

***But on a serious note;***

Yes, collective action is almost always needed. I don't think AI will go away. The luddite outlook of some leftists is valid and justified. I just don't think destroying it is also a good idea. Like a certain Marx said, "Seize the means of production!" or something. But, yes, we could theoretically have AI cooperatives.

Same as worker-co-ops. But yeah, you get me, quantized AI helping, et cetera et cetera. Though, honestly— If I was *with* people, I won't need to keep to AI a lot of the time. But yeah. Small steps. If we start, it's not going to be DeepSeek or Mistral level quality, nor it's going to be, for a while. But, hey, it's about helping each other right?

I'd say that due to the hyper-individualism of capitalism, people have been discouraged to just.. speak to people. Like, I'd feel AI would be less of a problem if one, creatives were allowed to be creative and make dumb/stupid/morally dubious mistakes in art/writing, we'd see less harm. 

Two, less stigma when it comes to discussing taboos, like, I get it, it's taboo for a reason, but if it were allowed to exist healthily visibly, it'd lessen AI dependence. And, I don't know, like, third; the rebirth of roleplay communities and their culture in the world. If it existed, I'd be in it, but, it's in the fringes, and if the other two conditions aren't met, this is also.. struggling.

## Outro

What now? *What is to be done?* That. Start that. Me? TBH. A mix of contiuning dependence on AI while knowing that if I am stopped, I shall stop. It isn't going to be easy, nor are you always going to be perfect in managing AI addiction. But always remember, that, even if you're alone, you can always kill yourse— I mean!! I mean— You can can— uh, you can go and speak to online people, your friends from anywhere (work, school, blabla)

I'm emphasizing that. Even though I joke around with dark topics, seriously, if you fail at talking, then that's fine. That's part of life, just.. move on and learn, even if you fail again. I.. just want anyone reading this to just start.. making mistakes, or doing/speaking dumb things, and learning from them! The key part is that. Proactive and Reactive Work.

Anyway, until I find another reason or new topic to yap about in AI.. I think that's all I have to say for now. Stay safe, alive, healthy and happy! Hopefully, see ya, and goodbye, peace!
