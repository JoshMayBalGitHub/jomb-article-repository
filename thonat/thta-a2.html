## Intro

Yes, this is a part 1, and yes, I expect to have more. Let's continue.

## Context

So, basically, I'm dumb. It was only a matter of time until a certain _AI Provider_ started paywalling services that exceeded a certain limit. Not that, I was not expecting it, but.. I was just, sad that it happened.

And yes, I use AI. No, I don't use it here, _mostly_. I've already explained my opinions in a much more dedicated article, this one's short, for just ranting.

## So.. How's Life?

Mostly fine, but.. still. The whole 'you can only do 200 messages' thing before you are stopped is restricting to me. Like, if I wanted to have effort in writing, I'd just... start writing?

Like, okay, I get it, it's all about the fun of making one but like, I swear I repeat the same roles in the same scenarios that if I actually wrote it, it'd take like 3 chapters then I'd get bored. Then, like sometimes, I don't even know what'll happen and if I did write it manually I had to come up with a way, which is the bloody point but.. yeah.

Anyways, I just feel sad now, that I can't infinitely use _that AI_ especially when it was so much better. Oh, yeah, there's still the free ones, but..

## Are you not Content?

I. don't. know. I feel so.. sluggish and bored whenever I switch to a free AI. I feel that as AI gets stronger, like.. the better it is, it's way harder to access without money.

Everything's money nowadays. At first, it was this AI, that AI either got paywalled or restricted, then move on. Like seriously, I just want to have an AI that doesn't have errors that are as obvious. Or boring ahh dialogue. And the roleplay thing where they talk for you?? UGH.

### Note:

I have a note from hours from the original draft. This is one. I.. still use _that AI_ but yeah, note to self: 'This is limited..' and I just have to live with it. I don't think any other AI has captured my laziness as well as _that._ So, yeah. 

## Outro

I'm just pissed, and that's it. I never thought I'd see the day that this would happen, but fuck.. all good things come to an end. They can't maintain that AI free for a long time, someone's gotta start paying up.. Welp, that's my short rant, see ya!
