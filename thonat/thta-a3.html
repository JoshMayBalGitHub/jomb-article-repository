## Intro:

Today, we're going to discuss a short overview (mostly) on the problems plaguing the country of the Philippines. Also known as where I am currently living. Today, we'll talk briefly on the modern issues and how it ties into the past.

## On Tax

In short, basically, according to [IBON,](https://www.ibon.org/even-more-money-for-the-rich-under-train-law-ibon/) the tax law that has remained the law for the past years or so has been directly affecting the poor on the downside, and the rich, not so much.

_**Sidenote:**_ I'm going to use [IBON](https://www.ibon.org/) as a source for a lot of these, but be aware that there are other sources, it's just, I agree with them the most, and have data to back it up. If you think they aren't like.. reputable, then that's on you, research it too! I'm only a writer that often theorizes and synthesizes, so if you have more sources or conflicting data, just discuss it!

### Analysis

This is just my thoughts on the thing, the yap you came for. Don't be a prude and just act like I'm just rambling about taxes while drunk.

So, yeah, as you can tell, a certain government is.. a bit biased, to the rich. TRAIN Law is a disaster, and should've been repealed or modified to actually hurt the rich. I don't know if it's true or not, but I heard that it barely benefits the poor, sizable to the 'working class' and it heavily benefits the rich.

The _working class_ I mean, is to the middle class. The poor and them are close, in that I separate them by how 'valuable' it is considered in the Philippines according to salary. As in, a doctor **probably** earns more than a garbage disposal worker. Or even a tricycle driver.

### The Minimum Wage Hike Never Seen

According to [IBON,](https://www.ibon.org/php200-hike-to-php1200-flw/) there was a House Bill No. 11376 that should have increased nationwide minimum wage to ₱100-200. Uh.. it hasn't passed yet. And it's not even enough, for some regions!! It was blocked by the Senate and I think until there's like an agreement by both houses over the bill, it will not happen.

## On Human Rights
