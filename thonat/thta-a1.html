## Intro

So, you know my DeltaRambles Commentary Series? No? That's fine. But, in short, if you do, it's that but less on story and devlogs. Basically yapping, like the test drive with the HSR one.

If you don't know or haven't seen it, don't worry, I am here to reiterate what I said, but without copying (mostly) the other one.

### INTRO

Welcome to jmb/caj's The Hontora Times, in which we'll discuss about whatever, as long as it happened during or after last week. _What is whatever?_ Whatever! As in, politics, culture, games, or whatever! **Seriously.** But, as with all articles there comes the pivotal question; "How long does each article get to be?"

The **answer** is..! _IT DEPENDS!_ In all seriousness though, most likely short, 1,000 word-type ones. Like, most of them are just short yaps, unless it's big but by then, it is an article of it's own right... Anyways, that's mostly for what this is going to be, why don't we talk about what got me here? 

Yes yes, I know, this is also personal.. But, the difference is, this one's related to whatever the topic is, which in this case, is the thing itself, while DeltaRambles should (but has deviated) be about how the story is related to my experiences. Anyways! Let's dive in!

Oh, and schedule is as implied, weekly. But, might be double release in one week if one week was skipped, again, this is a hobby. Everything hosted on this website (mostly) is. So, like unless someone pays me to yap, we'll get there when we get there.

Oh also, usually I'd like comments, but for now, since we have none, I'll direct to a gitlab issue repository dedicated to that for now. Maybe in the future, important comments are stored in it, but yeah, let's go.

## Why?

In short, video essaying without the video part. 

"So, normal blogs?"

_Yes._

Anyways, on how I got the idea and why, let's separate it into two main reasons; Past and Future.

### Past

In the past, I used to have so many criticisms and general passion for a lot of games but never got the idea to do 'em. Mainly because I didn't know how to write, and even when I did, I was.. so focused on so many things, that.. yeah. Let's just say, I want to move on, and try new things, especially since my _ADHD-riddled_ brain does that unconsciously anyway.

Oh, and my jomb-article repository is unused because of a falling-off I had with caring about being a P.I.O. in class, also known as the gal who tends to be the one most asked for what exactly happened that day. I had a good system for it too, what a shame. Hey, at least it's hosting this now!

### Future

If I'm going to take myself seriously as a writer in both fiction and nonfiction, I should explore nonfiction sometimes. Even if as rudimentary as this. I have like a bunch of good essays in comments that I feel like should be somewhere   "permanent". As in, not YouTube, or any other platform that isn't for dedicated blogs.

Also, jobs. If I'm going to have an idea in what people should expect me to be, I'll just send them an article, and that's that. Since, I'll eventually get to some topics that might be controversial.. Let's just say, if you disagree, we  CAN discuss it, _but_ note that in.. say, political stuff, I'll tend to and be biased to left-wing perspectives. And anarchistic ones too, if you're wondering what my perspective is in that way. But, that doesn't mean, I'll be dogmatic to it either..!! Just be _nice, respectful and cool_ about it, like always.

But, hey, I reserve the right to disengage. No matter what it is. That's just me.

## Outro

Anyways, that's about it, will I upload an actual article? Depende. I'll see whenever I'll get around to it, but if I don't, then this article is considered the article for this week! Alright, that's okay, then. See you, peace out and goodbye!

<!--The  reflection stuff again again again —caj~ -->
<p id="C2"><md-block># The Reflection on THaT</md-block></p>

## Intro

Ugh, I.. have to talk about this, huh? Well, let's get started already, I have a few things I realized while using AI (yes... I found the 200-limit to not matter..)

## Tone

Okay, let's set the record straight. I have this *tone* that might discourage certain topics. Say, there *is* a difference between certain topics in terms of; 

> "How to talk about it and How do I talk about it?"

Honestly? No clue. It seems that, if I ever see any actual comments, I'll have to constantly think and reflect on what has been said even if it's as meta as how I write about it. Like, when I wrote the intro, I didn't think it'd matter. but when I'm looking at the potential future of whatever this is going to be, I wonder how it'll be perceived.

Like, my type of friends and community are likely okay with it, but if I have to dive into some topic or try to write seriously, I just can't.

**I don't know.** It's so hard. It's so hard thinking about the future, then realizing that this part of my life isn't the only part I worry about.

Like, do I seriously have to think about what future commenters might say about what I write, right now?!

*Well.. apparently so, since I'm writing about it.*

Basically, my tone fits my commentaries and more fiction-based or chill topics, but if I want to talk about, say my opinions, on certain topics, that *will* definitely not be as.. agreed upon, I have to write differently, and.. the whole invisible expectation that you don't know exists until it does, it's.. hard to process.

## Audience

Honestly, a lotta people have intersecting interests, but— **not everyone is interested in my weirdness.** Like, okay, sure, you might like my politics or culture discussion, but you might not like my AI blogs or even not interested in my programming yap, or games!! If I ever do them.

That's the core issue. ***Audience.***

What exactly is *my audience?* I mean, this website is barely accessible in search engines, (currently using a 'free' hosting service..) and I don't feel I have enough *'credibility'* or *'interest'* so that people **want** to check out my website.

Like, aside from like, maybe Ao3 or Tumblr, there are basically no websites for like blogging that is actually.. accessible?? You get it, right? If you do find this, it's likely through some link I specifically shared. It's just.. basically, the old way of;

> "Have your own website for stuff!!"

Is.. dead. Like, unless I make something in the big microblogging websites (Twitter/X, Bluesky, Mastodon), YouTube, 'link aggregators' (Reddit/Lemmy) and any other place where people usually congregate, I'm basically writing to the void.

> "So.. make content??"

It's.. complicated. The only time *I've* personally visited someone's website is if they're popular on *those* websites I just mentioned. So, I'm asking for something I don't believe in. But like, you get it?? It's **unfair.** I'm still a **damn** student, and I feel that writing is my forte, and simply having to attach to *certain fandoms or certain platforms* feels bad, if like.. I guess if you're more cool with OC stuff instead of **fanart/fanfiction.** 

### Side-Tangent: Fanfiction/Fanart

Okay, is it just me or do I **dread** writing any fan creation of any fandom? No matter how nice they are, I feel that if I **would** invest time into writing, I **should** focus on OC, but.. nobody **cares** about OC. And like, honestly, that part is **already** so small.. Like, unless you're like.. an animator or a good artist, you're.. **invisible** to most people.

***Writing is so underappreciated.***

Like, in most social medias **where** the game/fandom is discussed, the writing is left to the people who **made** the game/fandom being discussed. So other people's creativity is **restricted** to basically theorizing on stuff. Like, I guess, you *could* be a resident.. artist/theorycrafter in stuff, but you'd need to be *very* dedicated. Like, **ignore OC stuff level.**

I don't know if I **should** pivot there, and as.. I think *implied* on my story commentary.. I do have **passion** for the games/fandom I'm in. But I use it to create OCs, **not** to expand stuff on the game/fandom itself. 

### Conclusion on Audience

Basically, I am **stuck** in between the broader internet space of stuff to be enjoyed and talked about and creating my own space there.

## Professional vs. Casual

I vaguely touched on this, but basically;

> "So, this is for future you? Will future you care about your informality? Wait, actually— this is detrimental, because your everything is on one— no, two websites. And, if you are for whatever reason, disliked? You are fucked, that's one more enemy."

I hate having to **think** about this. The opening up to a lot of people is strange. Like, having to think as both the creator and the reader. But, my **whole** rational is.. basically; *"Just.. do things, right now. Whatever future appears, it'll happen, and you couldn't have known about it."*

I don't know how to truly express it. It's like, having to choose between foods, while you're eating alone, and nobody cares.. yet, until you tell it to people and then they judge you for it (good/bad.. who cares) It's like, do I know I'll tell people? I do want to, but.. I feel that like.. I DON'T KNOW.. It's weird how I can't describe exactly why I have this certain avoidance and.. sudden aversion to sharing anything about this.

I think I touched upon this, mainly; *"Nobody cared. Why would they care now?"*

I.. honestly have no answer for that. This hits on 'If no one cares, why do I care about being professional?' but then again, what if someone does? It's that continuous cycle that I don't know will be solved, until someone actually starts caring..??? Should I care that other people care??? Yeah, this is hard to process.. I still feel that this topic *just* exudes;

> "I need other people, but I also don't talk to people very well. I need to talk about stuff with them, but I suck at actually making conversations that doesn't feel awkward to myself. I don't feel good bringing up topics on my own, and because of that, I have no reason to talk to anyone, perpetuating the cycle."

*That's the summary.*

## Exhaustion, Burnout and School

As much as I'd love to work on this, *school unfortunately exists.* I still feel *bad* for **'wasting'** my summer vacation on AI.. and then YouTube too.

I don't have anything else to say here that hasn't been said before in the June and May devlog in DR: Commentary.. 

I think the point is none of the contradictions and tensions have ever been resolved.

*These four, I mean;*

> Personal versus Art. I cannot write Season 1 and finish it without focusing on it without any other problems. While Season 2 and now, Mizo/Rika can only be written when I am going through stuff. And others are left as scraps to be picked upon when the other two are not satisfiable enough.

> The Vicious Cycle. Nothing can be as bad as being stuck in a cycle you can't escape. This is the same with writing. At least for me, for as long as I can remember, I've been.. scolded for using these as escapism. But, for how long can you make someone powerless or worthless until they collapse inward? The answer is a year.

> Outside, Calling. To realize how to breathe safely, you need to look around and realize the fact that you're an oppressed person, and you shouldn't feel guilt for acting like one. Lashing out, going into fantastical escapism.. that. Instead, you should fully believe these fragments of yourself so you can fight for others, and most importantly, yourself. For you cannot help anyone, if you are not helped.

> AI and Me. Hah. AI. AI huh? My healing and my incorrect substitute. Like how Kurt Cobain used certain illegal drugs for stomach pain instead of other things, that in retrospect, could've helped. Same with me, yes, I could have just dumped trauma on my friends, but I've chosen the unhealthy route. 

***Not a single one has changed.***

## Outro

I hate this, constant rethread into the same old topics about me and writing. But, I have to address it in context of why I made this thing in the first place, anyways, you enjoyed it? Next time, I guess, good night and peace!

<!--The reflection stuff again again again again. final. maybe. —caj~ -->
<p id="C3"><md-block># A Final (maybe) Word on this, for now.</md-block></p>

*Well.*

No, structure. Let's.. get this done with.

I have to admit something.

This.. has been the **most passionate** I've been writing.

The whole *Meta Talks* topic.

I've been.. **reflecting** a lot. Especially with **some**.. AI help.

I.. admit, it's.. all the **bad** words you **can** assign to it.

But, it's **me.**

I.. can't just.. keep spiraling. Or.. I might, but..

I'm getting tired of *pretending writing is perfect for me.*

What I mean is,

***I'm tired of expectations.***

It's been getting **too** heavy in school right now, and.. I want to **ease** it here, in something I can **control**.

So, from this... *day forward, this website, this.. whole.. mess,* will just be **me**. Writing to the **void.**

I.. should get writing.

*Actual writing.*

I should fix my website's bugs, or go finish Season 1-3.

I should continue.

I'll let the *currents* guide me.

I'll let myself write.

Just.. create.

If I spiral again, I.. won't be guilty, I'd accept how I felt, and move on again.

How many cycles? Well, many. It's just I've written mine.

Anyways, stay tuned for stuff.

More Mizo/Rika, C2S3 stuff and of course, completing the Philippines Critique.

See ya in a week, peace, and good night~!
