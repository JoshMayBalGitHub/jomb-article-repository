## Intro

### Preface 1

I dunno what I'm going to write about actually, I'm just.. going to write. I don't know if this is good to do, but it's all I know what to do, so.. let's just write it. I'll.. clean this up tomorrow before HOI4 or something.

— caj | 29 Oct. 2025 | 21:41

### Preface 2

Another writing session done, I think I know what I should put here, and what I should write, but as I have been rigorously learning, and been observing I shall leave it to myself in the future to pick this back up. The prefaces here will serve as how many times I opened *ghostwriter* to just.. write, whatever. Even if it's terrible, I'll fix it if it's too much. Anyways, that's it for this one.

— caj~ | 30 October 2025 | 02:13

### Preface 3

That's part three done. I think I'm going to stop my short word salad here, and just let it marinate and be published. It's not anything special, with meaning, and/or purpose, it is as is, written. I hope this was of use, of fun, or intrigue. If not, I'm sorry, I guess. All these prefaces, are more of how the author herself thinks of what has been written, without getting deep into rambles you probably should be warned about, but anyways.. here's to a ***spooky halloween~!***

## Driving Yourself Slowly Insane

I am thinking in a perspective that people would be able to access this information in a website that people can view easily, about myself, and so.. I'll self-censor a lot of personally-identifying info but yeah, I think this is just going to be cathartic, a mix of stories and personal anecdotes to express these.. ideas, thoughts, feelings in easier ways.

---

### My Role Defines You

"Why are you, sitting here, trying to define who I am, who.. who.. *she* is?"

"Do you know?"

"W—why yes of course! I—I am a girl with my own beautiful body, I am an activist for all people's freedom from oppressive systems, and a passionate writer and programmer of various software and stories!"

"Do you accept these identities of yours, fully?"

"I—I.. w—well..  sometimes I have to live this way, or that way..! I.. I don't know what it means to accept yourself fully, but I.." *She.. is noticeably tearing up.* "I.. I'm trying to, okay?! But that doesn't make it okay for you to keep hiding me from myself!"

"Yet you let me. Ask yourself, if you are so confident and steadfast in your thoughts and words, you remain stagnant, escapist, and a slacker for such things?"

"B—because people don't change in a week. A month. I.. don't remember why, but I keep thinking it'll change, my.. my things, my actions, they seem so.. inconsequential. It feels like, I'll do good, only to fall back again and again and—"

"Relapse. You are suffering an addiction."

"W—what?? I'm not. I'm not! Or.. it's.. just.. hm. But.. what do you want me to do?" *She holds him and shakes his shoulders.* "I don't have a world to look forward to, I don't have any.. *thing* I actually care about enough that I'll stick around and maybe do something meaningful. You can call it obsessions, addictions, but.. what?"

"I ask questions, I'm not here to debate what your reasoning are, I am only here to point out facts and help you get to where you want to go."

*She pulls back, and turns away.* "..." *She puts her hands on her chest.* "Then I don't have any. I can only describe what my problems are, try to make up a solution, then.. repeat." *She walks away.*

---

### Wander On

Sometimes I wonder why I keep asking myself why I write. I had a hard time even starting this. Just.. getting myself to start. But, it's all explainable. AuDHD, mix in C-PTSD of whatever tangled up mess of a person that developed it. But, on I went, because what would it matter if I keep ruminating? There's so much to write. There's so much emotions left to fiction, and I fail to write anything coherent. I'm losing my mind trying to justify and save face for whatever criticism seems to come my face. Is it just to make me sadder? Of course not, some of it is just concern, but learning to separate between numbing yourself to *any* critique and *working yourself to exhaustion* to **'correct'** any misgivings is just.. exhausting. When will I learn? I dunno.

## Taking Steps

### Pretty in the Dark Sky

"Such.. a beautiful starry sky." She says to him as they sit together on a cold night, while on an elevated hill. "Yeah, I guess." He says as the response made the two silent for a minute before she turns to him. "You.. have nothing else to say..?" She asks, as he shrugged and looked away, still looking up to the stars. "I dunno." He sighs. "I don't know what I feel nowadays." She looks slightly concerned but sighs, as she hugged him, **tightly.** "I love you, dummy. If that makes you feel good~" He smiles slightly as he reciprocates, but his eyes ever so slightly look at the left side of her head, before closing them. "I know, I.. love you too, darling." She audibly squeaked in happiness as she gripped his back tighter, their warm bodies and clothing pressed together in the cold illuminated night. They both pulled back as she looked away with a smile and slight blush and embarassment while he looked at her fondly, while having thoughts he won't burden the love of his life by.

After she got over the whole thing, she looked at him all smug before turning snarky. "Hey... what's with that look..?" She asked as he huffed and grabbed one of her hands and touched it, stroking it automatically as he looked down and sighed. "I.. just have a few.. doubts in my mind.." He admits, as she scoots over and makes him look at her with her other hand. "Heyyy.. if it's about us, we can talk about it..! O—or even s—something else, as long as you just tell it to me, heh." She reassured, as he chuckled. "It's.. not about us," He looked at her eyes and looked away immediately, then shook his head. "Eh— Well, not only. I just.. don't understand my feelings, is all." She tilted her head and audibly got confused as he elaborated. "I'm so paranoid that I don't actually love you, and that.. I have been faking and a bad boyfriend and—"

"B—but that's nonsense! You know that, right?" She interrupts him, as he sighs and shrugs. "I just try to ignore it, but.. yeah. I'm just.. I guess, I still am insecure even after meeting you, and I don't really know if this is all good to be saying too.. I.." His rambling was stopped when he gasped as she gripped on his arms. "Stop that.. I.. don't want you to.. think that you need to do more than what you are doing right now." She closed her eyes and sighed. "I.. also deal with insecurity sometimes, it's... haunting, and eats you away. It.. all goes away, if you talk to people." Her face gets closer to his. "Especially you, babe~" She booped his nose before pulling back as they looked at the stars again. "I need to get my flirting game up..." He comments as they chuckle.

### She's a Rebel

I think to why I have empathy but don't feel 'loved' or 'love'. What.. causes this? I don't think I don't *feel* love, but I feel it.. differently. Or, less obvious. I just think that sometimes, the emphasis and talk about love and friendship burdens me sometimes. I have to keep this certain *façade* to keep up with my friends. I have to play this game, do this, know that, and more performative acts of relationship-building. Performing isn't necessarily bad, it becomes that when you think you're forced to do so. I don't know if I'm inexperienced or just thinking cynically, but writing fluff/hurt-comfort like the above is very hard for me to do. Mainly because I don't know what it feels like to actually have one? I just feel like people are so used to it, and so willing to be attached to fictional people, with like romantic or even **sexual** intentions. I admit, I find some appeal, and that is why I still write and read them, but... I have a certain detachment to it all.

It really boils down to thinking and feeling, but not enough to be fully vulnerable to someone else. Maybe I got burned by my family, my former friendships, current identity crises. and current burnout/depression wave. But, it is also just, my general difference to other people.. I'll... explore that later, but in the context of relationships, it connects to how I look for 'smart' (really just *as knowledgeable* about certain topics as me) people but they're either very different from my brand of intellectualism, or *as* awkward and different from me that I can't find someone who I truly *truly* connect with. It's not that I don't have friends, but having **"best friends forever!"** is still out of my reach.

## Fill My Heart-Shaped Box
 
### Comes from Inside
 
"Hey dude." She greets him as she sits beside her. "Hey." He says back, while scrolling on his phone. "So, how's your novel? You done? Got the thesis..." She asked him before he answered abruptly, "Yea. I.. I'm doing it. It's.. getting there." He says, as she looks at her phone, takes a moment before sighing, and turning it off as she settled in the couch. "Um, what do you *mean* getting there?" She asked again, as he takes a deep breath before turning off his phone and looking at her all guarded. "Wrote a few chapters, some.. outlines, getting there, is all I'll say." He answered, as she pouted and crossed her arms. "You're.. not telling me the truth, hmph." He sighed and asked, "Why? I just told you, that's it."
 
"Fine..!" She relented, uncrossing her arms. "Okay, okay. It's just... you don't tell me anything about it." He gasped but kept his still face still. "Like, *what are you* writing? Come on, I'm your friend, I won't be mean, but I will judge you~" She said with a smirk, as he grumbled and pulled back slightly. "Well.. it's a mix of dubious consent and personal drama, all in a backdrop of fantastical magic interspersed with politics, fighting and love." She tilted her head before repeating, "Dubious.. consent?" He groaned as he shook his head. "It's.. complicated but yes, it does have that." She immediately asked, "W—what do you—How—eh—I mean, what I mean.. is.. what about it? What.. makes it.. important enough, to be in a summary...?"

"Uh.. dubious consensual kissing? *Slight* sexual stuff? Look­— why are we focusing on—" He was cut off by her finally relenting, "Okay fine— I just.. I was just so surprised is all." The two were silent as she spoke up again, "Um.. what are.. the.. romance there if.. there is any...?" He stilled for a second, before answering, "Features.. relationships, involving.." He paused, seemingly reflective before continuing, "Two souls constantly fighting to see each other, just for a moment underneath a dark cold night, where their warm hearts burn." He scratched his head before continuing, "It also has moments of people losing hope and turning to vices, people walking on strings of hope, stressed and stretched and.." He looks at her. "..fun times between those.. as the world moves."

She thinks about it, and let out a sigh of exasperation. "Man, you write depressing stuff." She gets up to get an orange-flavoured soft drink, and as she does, she continues, "I mean, not that I have any judgement— I just..." She picks the soft drink out and pours one out with ice on a cup as he joins her on the kitchen counter. She continues, "..think you'll benefit from enjoying life occasionally, you know? Even with all.. the chaos and mess of life." He nods slightly, as he gets a cup and lets her pour some as well, while he gets his own ice and answers, "It's.. part of it. But, I tend to write when I get inspiration which could be depressive or reinvigorating." He drinks, as she ends it off with, "Next time, don't be such a scaredy-cat about it, hm?" He huffed in amusement as she smiled slightly before drinking as well.

### A Long Time has Passed

I was.. reflecting when I wrote this. It's less.. love-coded and more chill. It's what I think would be a perfect way of seguing into what I think of my prospects. In life, I mean. Not just relationships, but it'll come up.

Okay, so what does it mean by writing for yourself? I've come to realize it's an answer that doesn't answer anything to what makes someone write. It's so basic and cliche that I want to dissect my own reasons to actually provide one, rather than letting the questioner be stupefied by a so-called 'answer'.

I write for a lot of reasons, like to get my thoughts and stories out, to express something, to feel feelings this way, to get stress off, to feel productive and to feel worth. Let's tackle these and connect them to my own personal life (I'll be anonymizing of course.)

To write is to think about why you are writing the words you input constantly and distil them into a digestible format, like essays, wikis or stories. I often think that I have a very weird approach to doing a lot of stuff, and this is one of them. It might not be practical or even sustainable to write nothing for a week then heavily write for a week, then randomly, chaotically switch between them, but I have long learned to accept my mess as a form I live in, whether I like it or not.

It's not that I give up on changing myself for the better, but I have to look at my material circumstances and say that without addressing the longing or starved dopamine of my brain, I can't start a lot of progress. When you look at writing that is nothing more than the finished product you begin to lose what it means to create, and the process behind it. Everything has a process. It's just that it's more of an instinctual one for me, as a writer. I can say that; "Oh, I go live my life for inspiration, then if I have time, or motivation I write it down and maybe refine it if I get time—" but a lot of that is dependent on 'time' and by extension, time management.

I find time management to be... challenging. Managing scraps of time just so you can be productive is hard for my AuDHD to process. It's like, asking me to follow something I don't want to, and that heavily stunts my creative process. Whether that's good or bad, remains to be seen fully, but objectively making my writing worse. I once saw that "with AI, you can do anything!" and that is factually false. Accessible Generative AI only helps if you are actually skilled, but only restricts you if you rely on it. I find myself struggling to write stories without AI guidance sometimes, and.. it's not that I rely on it, but it's literally just a common writer problem that only now has been connected to AI because you can use AI to solve it, if you use it correctly, but I don't feel good making AI write something I should do myself, especially when I'm working without external pressures (in terms of writing) or an audience, too.

*A lot of meandering, huh?*

A lot of rambling, yes, but I fail to see a reason to not to do so, after all.. It's a body of text, easier to skip and read through. You can re-read stuff, and you can highlight stuff, *emphasize stuff* and that is all harder to do in.. audio maybe, but the point is, this is more of a way for me to write what I am thinking and leave the reader to read whatever they wish to, as these types (the non-political, story/subjective writings) are less about discussing, critiquing and concluding but an entry of words meaningful to the interested that in the broader sense don't really change much, but *just exist* to tell and document who I am, and what am I, all those.. memories, of people, I dedicate a lot of my writings to them, believe it or not. 

**In fact,** if you were to do a posthumous wiki on my works, while analysing my diary and other hidden stuff I would prefer to keep to myself until my mortal demise, you'd find why I choose to censor stuff, you'd find why I wrote it this way, you'd find how certain writings were influenced by IRL personal events. But, that is left to you all, for me? All I am doing is writing and documenting the best I can, and what my person is.

...

Hm, on what my worth is, and what are my thoughts to the events that spark these little ramblings, I say that if I am worthless, then I lose burdens, and if these writings just.. disappear and my memory fades, I.. at least built something. I at least experienced these things, no matter how.. depressing, regretful or shameful they are. They are but **memories** now, anyway. Things change, people change, I change, and... while I would change stuff, have regrets, I believe through writing I keep myself sane and locked to the present, to not change the past, but to create meaning from it, whether sorrowful or hopeful.

Love? It's... something I look forward to, even as I fumble my way through it. Trauma can only spiral you so much before you stop, before you have to sit and say, I'm done, she.. she's gone for now, and if I spiral again? So be it, I just hope I find meaning without needing those feelings of love, to.. be 'loving' someone. Someone that.. could leave, to hurt, and to heal.

***I guess, that's it? I don't really have a moral lesson, or conclusion... The talk has gone on and on, and I don't think anybody would like these ~3,000 words that in all sense, basically boil down to 'I don't know' but... I already wrote it. Might as well publish it, and maybe I'll find it useful, hah.***

So, I just realized to do that I'm gonna have to use my already limited phone battery, and... Nah. So, uhh... I'll just write whatever I remember and leave it up to editor caj to deal with it while me, jmb will try and explain my own lore while my own lorebook is stuck in my phone (preserving charge) or my laptop's hard drive which while useful, I'm kinda somewhere where I can't access it, so you're just going to have to bear with me.

Adjusting my position here is a fudgin' nightmare, as of November 10, 2025 @ 02:28, I can't get a good angle where my keyboard is stable while my body doesn't end itself. Damn, this sure is unwieldy, if only I were at my desk.... I think that, if it weren't for how tiring it was to sit in that chair I probably would've gotten some work done, but maybe I'm just making excuses...Well, I got time, unfortunately.

I really do hope the electricity comes soon, as much as I love writing (typing) I'm only doing this because I can't fucking sleep. I just can't. What do you mean you have to lay in your own sweat drenched bed for ~5 hours at most because of a typhoon? Don't you have a generator? Well, doesn't that cost gasoline anyway? Even so, are we sure it'll last? I tried to make the typhoon pass over by watching videos but, welp, here I am writing in god's hope I won't go insane here.

Sometimes, I'm tempted to use my phone but then I look at my situation then shamefully sit here doing fuck all while adjusting myself so i don't die of dengue by mosquito bite. Everything here feels terrible, my arms feel like they're being stung by insects half of the time, my body is awkwardly shaped, my eyes feel blind and dry because going into dark mode would kill my view of the keyboard, and god fucking dammit I can't sleep without my fucking blanket who goes to any thing without one?! At least you'll have protection if you have a blanket, if you don't, have fun with bites!!!  Okay, my eyes need rest, hopefully by 3:00 it is much less agonizing. Gotta go, @ 2:47, signing off!

Okay, it's like.. 03:05 now, gotta say, all that did was rest my eyes, my mind was still up, waiting or... at least wary of how my body was positioned. You see, it's fucking weird. I sleep in this weird half bed setup where there's a bed beside this one in this small ass room, and basically I sleep across them like a dumbahh because someone was in the other bed (I won't say because if you know, you know) that basically made me say nahh I ain't sleeping next to them. I mean, it wasn't that hard to do so if there were air and cooling but without it? Bruh, I AIN'T SLEEPING. I JUST LITERALLY CAN'T. GOSH. DAMN. IT. So yeah, that's why I'm stuck here, typing at 03:11 unable to do shit but hope for the electricity to go back up, damn.

Well, if your very much working parents are fast asleep there's still your... Friends and siblings! Sometimes, talking with someone who didn't raise you or even just someone that like.. Iike... good? Someone to challenge and affirm your viewpoints, see if you're not just going insane or are going in circles. You need someone to look at you and comment, not because of like.. 'I wanna see you become better' because I just think that's too much to ask but just a different way of thinking, of perspective, because of just sharing ideas and seeing what to do with them and what to do and what not to do.

Damn, it's 3:56, and I just gotta say, its crazy how hours pass and I'm still in the dark going cray-cray while sharing like.. Important life tips between me and my sis. Gosh darn it, how is it possible to have this much ignorance, electric corporation?! Not that me complaining would do anything but what else, sleep? Yeah right, if only we had electricity to- now wait a minute! I swear, a lotta of this could be Mizo/Rika or Main Season writing right now! Only and **only** if I get my electricity back! Who willingly lives in concrete houses anyway if it weren't for electricity?! That's right, literally everybody else!
