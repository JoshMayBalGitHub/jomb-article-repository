## Intro

So, to set things straight, I'm going to ramble about politics, culture and army in a way that only if you played HOI4 for a long time with mods that you'd totally get. As the title indicates, we are focused on The Fire Rises Mod. Anyways, hope my rambling does something!

## Table of 'Topics'

1. On the APLA
2. THE SECOND AMERICAN CIVIL WAR
3. The Arabian Civil War (+ Early Game Opinions)
4. THE ACTUAL CIVIL WAR and My Experiences
5. Post-Civil War 'Recovery'
6. America Awakes

## On the APLA

What the fuck is the APLA you ask?

It's the 'American People's Liberation Army'... Yes. A communist one. Well, technically, a general left one, led by a.. hmm. well.. you can broadly separate the factions of this 'country' into...

1. 'Patriotic Socialism' led by Maupin apparently...? It's in the name. Combining American Nationalism and Socialism, somehow.
2. 'Octoberists' or basically Marxist-Leninists, I don't remember any leaders except Maupin lol but yeah, this is where the PSL are I think... oh yeah, Gloria La Riva.
3. 'Neosocialists' or like DSA but the far-left caucuses, usually more democratic, federal, and like.. similar to actual DSA but adapting to the.. ahem, *civil war.*
4. 'Anarchists' or AnComs. Led by Mark Bray, I guess. It seems contradictory that Anarchists have a leader, but this one is somewhat syndicalist in nature, and there's gotta be a 'head' or 'leader' even if elected and agreed upon, or natural??

Oh yeah the Second American Civil War.. that. Um, let's.. I should probably say why, huh?

## THE SECOND AMERICAN CIVIL WAR

So, why?

Well, Oil Crisis in Saudi Arabia, and the usual political polarizations in the USA. Apparently, instead of George Floyd, roughly around 2020, some white man named Quinton Evans, was shot. Then, it spirals. But, you might wanna know, who opposes our main topic, which is the APLA? Well.. aside from the APLA, we have..

1. 'American Constitutional Government', or Trumpist Faction. ON Denver, lol. Basically, right-wing populists, mixed with American 'libertarianism', and some authoritarian nationalists (The Patriots~!) I find this path to be interesting, but apparently, has a weaker start, due to being the secessionist part of the Civil War, but.. well, I'm not hiding it. I have a leftist bias, and tend to cheat in HOI4 to make my leftists win.. Anyway, they usually win because.. I'll explain in the 3rd number.

2. 'Union of America', or Democratic/Neoliberal Faction. On.. D.C., duh? Led by my boi, Joe Biden! Anyway, you can get Kamala Harris if Joe Brandon (Joe Biden) dies. This is the most 'normal' path. Literally, Liberal, Progressive or Conservative 'Never-Trumpers'. Is the preferred supported country of the other former NATO allies, and.. yeah, uh.. you'd think it's boring.. oh no no, for some reason, a 'Caligula' path exists. Biden, goes Caligula. I do not know how they came up with that, lol. 

3. The Patriot Front / The National Socialist Movement, the Fascists. Yes, they're separate but are close enough to bunch up. Basically, it's from Autocracy, Ultraconservatism, 'American' Fascism and Neo-Nazism, with it having the 'kill them all' faction and the 'no, make them.. subjugated instead!' faction. You get it. It's fascism, out and about. I separated this from Trump because they'd usually declare war on Trump and/or Biden to fully realize their ambitions. So these are the extremists who live on the fringes, and have guns to prove it. Oh, and Trump won on my game because these two allied with the following movement after this number, fracturing the Biden faction's troops.

4. Other Secessionist Rightists: The Southern Movement. Dixies. Yeah, uh.. they're not developed yet, so.. yeah. They usually are anti-union, but can get aligned with the fascists if threatened. The Army of God in the West, and Mormons in Utah.. Pockets of Aryan Brotherhoods, some libertarians stuck in cities like the Bandidos, Highwaymen, and Hell's Angels... Some 'Folkish' Movements, the.. JDL?! Hmm.. The KKK exists, more neo-nazis, warlocks, Vagos, and yeah yeah, some neoliberal states (like, states like Arizona, California), and military juntas, commands of regions. Honestly, I don't get how these would separate, why would an air command, or some junta wouldn't support the neoliberal state with them. Though, they can do that, it's just.. they die before that happens.

5. Other Secessionist Leftists: Black Liberation Army, they fight the racists dixies in the black cities, they usually die if not supported... Mountain Collectives, Antifa CIties, Red Guards, basically secessionists that didn't manage to connect with the APLA before they died. Mainly because the APLA were in California and they either die to the hostile forces, or get crushed / integrated by the APLA, depending on what happens, how you play the APLA.

6. Gangs, there's a lotta them, I forget how many, it's like MS-13, the Bloods, Crips, there's like a bunch ton really. They like.. appear because of instability, are crushed easily, and are usually rehabilitated or shot, depending on who you are.

*HEY! I KNOW YOU BARELY PAID ATTENTION!*

I mean, I know I wouldn't if it was math that I had to explain, but yeah, so.. in short, a mess. Everything's a mess once the U.S. collapse. There'd be the Mexican Civil War, Colombian Civil War, the Central American Unification War, the North African Unification War, the Myanmar Civil War.. et cetera. Oh, almost forgot;

***The Arabian Civil War***

## The Arabian Civil War (+ Early Game Opinions)

So, first even besides the 2NDACW, is this. How is it divided? Well, it's shorter, really. After Abdulaziz (Saudi Arabian Crown Pince) died of COVID-19, Salman took charge but was very controversial, with the oil crisis, yemeni civil war, and the start of the royal purges, civil war occured.

1. Salman Loyalists - Self Explanatory, but support here is mainly UK, Russia, UAE and Singapore
2. Royal Prince Alliance - Anti-Salman, PRC, Turkiye, and the other Arab/Muslim States
3. Republicans - Led by Yahya Assiri, democratic. Supported by Israel, other West Allies, India and Kurdish Autonomous Regions
4. Hezbollah - Iran, and it's Axis of Resistance, and Syria.
5. 'Jaysh Alfath' - No one, they're alone.

Blabla, you get it. Anyway, I supported the Republicans (as Trump/Biden before Civil War), and had a little 'fun' rediscovering how divisions work. I mean, I swear, I felt like my mechanized can barely move or attack without looking and seeing the enemy walk in because our troops don't have enough people. Girl, I feel tired just thinking about it. And so, basically, before I got Civil War'd myself, the Republicans only had to eliminate the royal prince alliance.

Honestly, pre-war is boring. It's really just economy management, which is seeing how far your debt can go up since your govenment ~~is not going to pass the time pass.~~ What the fuck did I write, bruh. I wrote that half-asleep, and thought it made sense, anyway... About Debt Management, it's.. genuinely confusing on how to manage it as the APLA, and like.. I may or may not have took the debt of the U.S. crippling my socialist utopia. Like, why did I do that??? I modded in 2040s Multirole CAS and Strat Bombers, I do not care if the IMF comes for my ass, I WILL Bomb their headquarters, wherever it is. Anywho, it slowly increased in the pre-Civil War era, and really, it was the most boring point-and-click plague inc. simulator besides from 'funding the movement' which I guess made the left stronger? CHAZ was never suppressed, anyway, and yet they still died when the Civil War happened. Ah well.

Like, elaborating on the Plague Inc. Simulator, it's clicking on states to mask them, then vaccinate them while focusing on getting as much mask/vaccine development as much as possible. BTW, Covid-19 magically disappeared during the Civil War, which.. isn't realistic, but.. I'd say a correct decision because of how stressful it already was playing the Civil War.

Oh, right.. my other 'interventions', um... I managed to get the Tigray Liberation Front more time before they got annexed by Ethiopia, then.. after years, get released because Ethiopia lost... the war of the Nile River, Egypt / Sudan vs Ethiopia? Not sure, but they got split, and somaliland disappeared since somalia joined. Oh, and I think I helped against Al-Shabaab before and after the civil war. 

## THE ACTUAL CIVIL WAR and My Experiences

As mentioned, I played as the APLA. So, uh... I forgot a lot of what happened, but basically, we were separated for three parts; The North, based on the coast of California, it had less of the units, and so defended mostly against the Army of.. I don't remember, basically Neoliberal Soldiers. The South, which was between San Franscisco, and L.A. being taken over by gangs, so basically stuck somewhere in between. And San Francisco, the main city, surrounded by some neoliberal soldiers. Honestly, I don't know how these military juntas work? Like, don't they support one of the government fighting? Like, I guess they do align with whoever wins afterwards, I think it's because it's way easier to manage. Because if I started off at war with everyone, I'd die instantly. Because I was only at war with California, and it's respective secessionists. Like, I think it took a year just to defeat these soldiers, and ahem ahem, North Korea, Cuba and Nicaragua volunteer support is really really cool. A lotta gangs, and neoliberal commands around, and I kinda blurred who I was fighting, as I was locked in.

Hmm, the Party Politics were kinda easy to manage, honestly. Like, you'd think that lobbying the anarchists would piss off the MLs and.. uh.. Patriots???? But, even though they're subversive, they still kept with the war, and I didn't really need to do much modding until much much later, when I forgot to create good divisions. The Congress is easy as it turns out if you just 'compromise' everything. Like, I was at 85% decentralization and they did nothing, lol. So, I was so imperfect that all of my leftist allies died before I could go and save them outside of California. I thought the Chicanos were my allies, but I had to fight them, apparently. Like Antifa and Maoist Guards, Collectives, Liberation Armies they all died before I could look to the east.

This mod, uh.. it's.. very prone to crashing. I don't know if it's the Clausewitz Engine sucking, or some random bug, but yeah. Like, I swear, I have to wait a month or at least disable some 3D models or shit, I don't know. It's stupid too, I have to go and look at the logs myself than seeing what crashed the damn game. I looked at it and it made no sense to what I was doing, I was managing the Civil War of France after... we'll get to it but it's a PRC focus tree texture bug. HUH??? Where was the PRC texture I missed???

Okay, so.. let's get back to the war, so after I wiped the Cascadians (who existed?) after employing some.. division manoeuvring˙, which is teleporting my soldiers like a naval landing without any navy (is that really the UK version of 'maneuvering??) I managed to win the war. Then after that it kinda mixed in, as I fought in Nevada, Utah and New Mexico / Arizona, Trump defeated the Far-Right Extremists who defeated my leftist allies and Biden, and so got the states who were loyal to a union government to declare war on me, which pushed me all the way to California, Oregon and Washington State. And so.. here comes the..

'The Invisible Bombers' - 2040s Multirole CAS and Fighters, goal is to bomb my enemies so they're as weak as my battered veterans.

'The Tsar Bombas' - 2040s Strategic Bombers, goal is to bomb.. bomb anything really, but focusing on airfields, anti-air and radar to cripple any form of opposition in the air.

'The Eagles' - 2040s Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, who terrorized the cities with my strat bombers, focused on industry and logistics.

With my new three time-traveled, console commanded 5000 future air equipment that I can somehow run, blazed through the Americas. And honestly, the rest is history. I smash my enemies, simple as that. Though after fighting brutal wars in my states, then the Rockies, back to where my frontline was, then to Denver and Texas, before my new militias, 'landed' (teleported) in D.C. and New Jersey, fighting and seizing the capital to force Trump to a peace deal and so I win! Woohoo..

## Post-Civil War 'Recovery'

Lessson learned: don't zoom in france

This is my problem with these types of total conversion mods, if something like this happens it's like... what now? Do you just not have 3D units? They're like why we play HOI4 instead of HOI3, because it has the unit on them instead of the division representation only. Like, I lost that btw. Let's.. rewind to right after winning the civil war, okay so my country, progresses normal, some bickering and social revolution here and there..

Since my 'country' is recovering, let's look at my foreign volunteer interventions. Firstly, I made the Zapatistas win in Mexico, ELN in Colombia, and.. well.. Russia. OKAY OKAY LOOK, I get it, 'Why'?' My answer is because it'd way more interesting. Like, there's that _small_ chance that Russia would have lost the European War if I didn't send my airforce from the future, buuut.. well I made them win. Sorry, uh.. fictional people there, I was planning to make NATO/EU lose so Commmunism would take hold.

And well, kinda? I succeeded in getting the IRA (the terror ones) to win their unification, and Spain and Portugal are under their left governments after helping them in their civil war. However, the UK and France stuff was a mess, like.. I tried to help the Provence Antifa, but my 1 unit was outclassed since I forgot to research 2027s era guns, my air was limited since they have little airfields, and.. they got crushed. The 'French Commission' or just the Eurocentric Government won, since I couldn't help the Paris Commune, because I think that happened when I was focused on Iberia, and I couldn't send my volunteers in time.

What made me realize my outdatedness in my troops is the Scotland and Finnish debacle. I had sent troops to both to fight off Ultraconservative UK and Russia respectively, but they were easily being defeated even with my airforce because of how weak the country I was supporting was in the first place. Then, I only realized how outdated my templates and miltech were. It's honestly a whiplash since I'd been winning the war for people, but so I had to go and train and develop tech until...

**_The Crimson and Green Offensives._**

## America Awakes!

What are these? Well, I suppose I should say;

**_The Canadian and Mexican Offensives._**

Yep, and after recruiting and putting down some airplanes, I was ready.. so, how'd it work out?

Well, I forgot to have troops in Washington State.... Which meant they.. got in.. bruh. I sent in my trainees and they somewhat held the line, but the Canadians were pushed back by my lovely DPRK, Central American (formerly Nicaragua and allies) and Cuban Volunteers, which is cool. On the other side, I pushed them easily in the western border, even in the great lake area! However, I had a harder time in the midwestern area, where I had much more spread out troops, and so less attackers, but we were able to go back-and-forth there..

Okay, part 2 later, I have to go do stuff; If I upload this without a part 2, that meant I ran out of time and will be continuing the save in a later time, so.. if that's the case. Yeah, that's.. where it ended. As of right now, I have pushed Canada out of the traditional provinces in the West like Quebec, Newfoundland, and Ontario. I haven't progressed much in others, but it's a clear win, it just needs more time. Oh, and I almost forget, the Western Naval Command, basically leftover American Unionists, I'll also battle them because of Alaska. Hope they capitulate when I seize Alaska. If not, well.. they better watch out for when I land in Puerto Rico and Hawai'i.
