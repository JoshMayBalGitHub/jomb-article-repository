# Jomb-Article-Repository

This is a collection of articles from my school and personal journey that had contributions by others, see [Credits](#credits). The current point of this website is to contain my non-story focused articles, like **THaT and the Old Articles,** and preserve my old school related web design stuff. 

~~This is a article / newspaper / school / website that was created by me and others (see [Credits](#credits)), to have fun! and for school too!~~ outdated but will keep here until further notice.

## Project status 

Currently, after the retraction of the previous project status, the following is the situation;

1. The Hontora Times! Every, somewhat week or so.
2. School related stuff on preservation mode until I get pestered to use it again.
3. Old Articles are also temporarily on preservation mode until I rework it like ThaT.

***as of July 14, 2025.***

~~School stuff is inactive and the articles are rarely updated too.~~ outdated as of July 14, 2025
