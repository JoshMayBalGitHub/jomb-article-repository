  <p><span class="big-letter">So</span> with gadgets today, "Freedom" is less than what i like so thats why I installed <b>Linux </b>and <b>AOSP</b>. But problems 
    with these software come up and I suffer from it. Here are my rants, concerns and other experiences when it comes to the FOSS space around these type of gadgets / 
    devices:</p>
<p class="titles">Linux and AOSP Issues?</p>
 <p class="all-list">So first, the AOSP space:</p>
  <p>I had many issues with specifically <b>crDroid</b> on my currently lost <i>Redmi 9T</i>. <b>crDroid</b> is a good ROM but the maintainer (still good) of this 
  specific device was changing the 8th version way too much during my time with it (May 2022 to January 2023) as i think(?) during July 17 2022, after the 8.7 update, the 
  back camera just stopped working, just straight up! Like it was being used and couldnt be accessed but there was nothing using it, so basically for one to two months i 
  was out of a phone camera. It was fixed and I was happy, until the next few updates had me wipe my fucking phone for 2 times! Like, what the fuck! I can't just do that
  every month!</p>

  <p>So after the last wipe, i stayed with that version (8.9) until my phone was lost and uh thats another story that we are not talking about but in short, I
  am a dumbass and lost my phone at home while preparing to go to school, and we never found it. I bought a new one and during that time, i was conflicted about installing
  <b>crDroid</b> on the <i>Redmi Note 11 Pro</i>, as i was in school during that time and would had to wipe it after a week of buying it and I just stuck with <b>MIUI</b> 
  probably until they stop supporting it which is next year. About waiting a week, yeah <i>Xiaomi</i>, even though it's not as bad as the others, it's still bad as you have to 
  register a <i>Mi</i> account, then use mobile data (had to use a SIM card) to connect to <i>Xiaomi</i> servers to "verify" then wait a week until you can Finally unlock 
  it and start having fun.</p>

  <p class="all-list">So Next, Linux, Secure Boot and Gaming:</p> 
  <p>I had many issues with getting <b>dual-boot</b> to work and since I am a dumbass i had to wipe my system 2 times, during the time i had
    my <i>Redmi 9T</i> (May 2022 to January 2023), also i wiped my hard drive accidently after trying to manage my partitions sooo i was very emotionally unstable during these
    times and uh yeah after that whole debacle, i was like "hmm, lets try to get <b>VALORANT</b> working" which was a mistake. And the only thing stopping me since i run a 
    <b>dual-boot</b>,
    <i>(dont worry i learned)</i> was turning on <i>Secure Boot</i> since <b>vAlORanT</b> needed it which is a whole other topic about <i>kernel-level anticheat</i> that i 
    PERSONALLY despise 
    but anyway
    i had to get it running.</p>
    So i need to find a way to get <b>EndeavourOS</b> (haha i use <i>Arch</i> btw, funny joke since its <i>Arch</i>-based), working on <i>Secure Boot</i> so i first tried 
    <b>shim</b>,
    which was a fucking mess and actually led me to my second wipe but practically, i was messing about in my EFI stuff and the thing i hate about <b>shim</b> is that
     rEFInd USED TO
    not fully support it so i had to make workarounds but that didn't work such as when i tried changing the refind file to be recognized by <b>shim</b> but still 
    "<i>Secure
      Boot</i> Violation", so i tried <b>PreLoader</b>, it worked! but the problem is apparently it expires in <i>2026</i>, so i am finding a way such as sbctl and 
      with the new
     0.14 update, it should
  be fine but as of right now i haven't tried it but still, it shouldn't be that hard to enable <i>secure boot</i> and use <i>linux</i> at the same time. Now I can play 
  <b>valorant</b>, but i wish this
method of anticheat will dissapear into the shadows and never be used again but the world is a 
cruel place.</p>

<p class="titles">So yeah that's pretty much it, That's all my complaints for now. Thanks for reading and Good Bye!</p>
