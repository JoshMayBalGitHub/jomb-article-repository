  <p><span class="big-letter">Hey!</span>So, it's been a while, huh? Well, I have been busy, with the other projects, if you've noticed, and well you see the new stories,
  the DeltaRambles Saga? Yeah that one, I've been thinking, for a while now. Since I unfortunately play <b>Genshin Impact</b> and <b>Honkai Star Rail</b>... I have seen
  the darkness that is character-based rpg's with the dreaded <b><i>gacha system</i></b>. Now, I wish to have a combat-based game like Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Rising
  Revengeance, but with the more character-based open world rpg that <i>Genshin</i> excels at.</p>
  <p class="titles">Ok, but why are you doing this?</p>
  <p class="all-list">Well, because:</p>
  <p><b>First</b> off, It's just for fun. I mean, I like programming but I don't know where I should start and I should at least have drafts of stuff that I will <i>eventually</i>
  make, keep in mind however that these are <b>subject to change</b>, as my opinions and the practicality of it change through my life and the <i>eventual development</i> (if it
  ever happens). I also see the <b>issues</b> I have with these type of games, and I want to change them to be like mine. But for now, this is what I am thinking, and if I ever
  change anything, I will explain in the subsequent posts of the game.</p>
  <p class="titles">The Actual Proposal</p>
  <p class="all-list">Synopsis:</p>
  <p>It's going to be <i>hack and slash</i> type, combo based attacks like <i>DMC / MGRR</i> and is as I mentioned earlier, a <i>character-based role playing game</i>, basically it has
  characters you unlock. It's based on the story I am currently making <a href="#drgs-link">(link at the end of the article).</a> The basis is that Mijo, a random student 
  at Honrato Pez, a prestigous school at his home city, has fallen into another world, where all manners of monsters and enemies exist. It is an open-world game (with some
  limitations, see below.)</p>
  <p class="all-list">Main Gameplay:</p>
  <p>What I mean when I say <i>hack and slash,</i> is that each character has their own combos using their <i>weapon of choice</i> and that, while <i>moves</i>> won't change. the <i>weapon</i>
  does, i.e. Mijo is a swordfighter, and he uses a katana. It could be anything as long as it <i>makes sense to how the character moves.</i> The system on how you <i>get weapons,</i> is
  that to get them, you need to <i>earn them,</i> you'll need to earn <i>currency</i>, this currency is given <i>free</i> throughout the game and events, as I plan this to be a live-service
  game that is already finished (like how the <b>gacha games</b> do it). The <i>character system</i> is divided into these parts, <i>first,</i> the stats. abilities and skins of the
  character, <i>second,</i> the weapons, <i>third,</i> sequential upgrades, <i>fourth,</i> the talents, and <i>fifth,</i> the voice overs and info (lore) about the character.
  It is an open-world game, but is restricted in some areas (such as the school, inside or outside.)</p>
  <p>This paragraph is for my thoughts on how I made it, I think that the gacha system is inherently bad, but at the same time, how would I capture the same hype whenever
    the character releases? For now, it is earned through just getting a very rare currency, but I am still not sure on how I should go about it, the only thing I know for
    real, is that there's a character system, I just don't know how it the player will get the items that the system uses. I am also not sure about the <b>'sequential upgrades</b>
    thing, which is a copy of the <i>constellation / eidolon</i> system in <i>genshin and hsr</i> but since they are more tied into the gacha (getting the same characters
    is part of the spending), I don't know how I can make it fair, but also good for me. I am also still not sure about the monetization, I could go with the microtransactions
    that Clash of Clans has, have a way of spending (of their own discretion) to get the character, but at the same time, also offering a type of battle pass that is more 
    long-term, but often fair enough to be reasonably completed in a month. The open-world aspect is also something to think about, I want to have a hybrid of the <i>parlor
    car in hsr</i>, but exploration like <i>genshin</i> (maybe something like what <i>hsr did with penacony?</i>)</p>
  <p class="all-list">Other Gameplay:</p>
  <p>The other less important aspects are here, such as daily commissions (because live-service), domain system, relic system,  exploration (like how the player moves 
    around), event ideas (appeals to casuals, sometimes chill), endgame (like bosses and domains that appeal to hardcore), energy system (i am thinking of removing, but 
    not sure how that would affect yet) and lastly, of course, achievements. This is shorter because I haven't  thought much about  it, If I get time, I will say my 
    thoughts on it, for now, they are included and are going to be in the game.</p>
  <p class="all-list">Story and Setting:</p>
  <p>The story and setting are of course, based on <a href="#drgs-link">my story.</a>. Which I will finish, but currently in this draft, I will say that in retrospective,
    it is a mix and match of everything I watch and enjoy. The current arc as of the writing of this article (season 1 chapter 3), is based on some aspects of hsr. But
    there are some changes of course, to fit the deltarune and hsr mix. But to put it in another way, it is a deltarune-based original creation / story based on fantasy
    aspects of genshin and hsr, with combat that matches the style of DMC and MGRR. This whole draft is a way of putting together my thoughts on a theoretical game that
    If I get the chance, I will make.</p>
 <p class="titles">Ok, what now?</p>
 <p class="all-list">Conclusion:</p>
 <p>I feel like, this took a lot of weight on my shoulders, as I have been thinking about this idea for a while now, and while it will probably change, and some things
  might not go my way, I still made tbis, and if I ever improve in my game development skills, I will make a mockup of this at least. Though from my ideas, it is going to
  a bit more resticted due to me not having a huge budget, neither the people or time to make it. I hope that this game proposal will be of some use in the future and as I
  continously think and improve it, it might even be turned into a full-fledged video, or with some reference images / drawings so that I can better visualize it. Anyways,
  I still have to complete the story this was based upon, and I have to get back to my real life duties, so see you soon, i don't know when, but soon.</p>
