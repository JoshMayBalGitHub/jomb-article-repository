  ## Context
  This is imported from Lemmy/Philippines, I wanted to save it here, for future reference and also addition if needed. It deserves an article for being so long.
  Anyway, more edits *if needed,* and will be added.
  
  May question ako, after the whole abandoning of this community.. Is there any hope for any move outside of the main social medias? 

  # Intro
  I've thought about this, since I've been exploring **Mastodon, Bluesky vs Twitter/X.. Nostr**. Any move outside of the main three, **Facebook, Twitter/X, and Reddit**.. 
  fizzles out like this one. While there still remains somewhat of a community, such as the more popular communities in this fediverse.. I wonder what's the hope of 
  switching away from the dominant socmeds if there is no homegrown movement here. I mean, look at me, I very rarely post, and look at Lemmy since any important info is 
  almost always in reddit due to search.. 
  
  # Reflection
  **Don't get me wrong..** We all have lives outside of social media, (~~especially me~~), it's just.. very hard to come back and look at the multiple of dead communities, 
  knowing you don't really have much to contribute. Like look at the many news posts, and random discussions.. Somebody has to take charge, and it's not going to be me.. 
  I have so many things to do. My point is, there is low hope for any alt socmeds to reliably grow, if either the people that moved just.. move on from being 
  *chronically online* or go back (to the big three), due to a multitude of reasons.
  
  # Conclusion
  I think I'm just exhausted with my life, and that has permeated with my internet usage too. There's too many negative videos/posts that I have viewed, but there is 
  much regret and procrastination outside. In conclusion..? I rambled for three paragraphs about Lemmy and the Fediverse, The Big Tech Social Medias, and the 
  Philippines / Internet Culture..
  
  *Hope ya got something out of it!*
